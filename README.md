# PRO-C-44
Project for class 44. Self design game stage 1


1. What is the title, and the inspiration/motivation of the game.
   Tower Parkour, and the inspiration was just thinking about the sky

2. What is the storyline of the game.
  The main character, which is a ball(for now) jumps accross a series of sky scrapers and other platforms to reach the end, while competing against other players.

3. What is the goal of the game.
  The goal is to reach the end of all the levels, with the shortest time out of the set of players competing.

4. How many characters are present in the game? List the out...
  There are 3 players that play the game, and NPCs, like the scrolling background, the sky scrapers, the various platforms, bird and electric wire obstacles.

5. What are the playing and non playing characters?
  The playing characters are the 3 players interacting with the game, and the NPCs listed in the section above are the non playing characters

6. Describe the behaviour of each character in detail
  The three players, use h ys or the WASD keys to move around. The left and right keys, or the A and D keys, move the players left and right. The up key, W key and space bar makes the character jump while the S key and the down keys make the character duck to avoid obstacles. The skyscrapers scroll across the screen and must be jumped on, or else the player will fall into the void, making them restart the level. The skyscrapers are platforms and have to be jumped on top of, or else the player will slide down the side of the tower. The background scrolls accross the screen with the players movement. The platforms, for example clouds(not realistic at all) can be jumped on top of and can be used to cross big gaps. The birds fly near you, and if you run into them, you have to restart the level. To duck under the birds
